       "Okay, the user is asking why the sky is blue. I remember that this is a classic question related to the scattering of sunlight. Let me think about the process step by step. \n",
       "\n",
       "First, sunlight is white, but it's actually a combination of all colors. Each color has a different wavelength. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the molecules and small particles in the air. I think Rayleigh scattering is involved here. Rayleigh scattering refers to the scattering of light by particles much smaller than the wavelength of the light. \n",
       "\n",
       "So, shorter wavelengths (like blue and violet) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (like red and orange). That means blue light is scattered in all directions by the molecules in the atmosphere. But wait, why isn't the sky violet then? Because even though violet light has an even shorter wavelength and is scattered more, the sun emits less violet light than blue. Also, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, so we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet.\n",
       "\n",
       "But I should also mention the role of the atmosphere's composition. Nitrogen and oxygen molecules are the main contributors to this scattering. The presence of other particles, like dust or water vapor, can affect the color, but under normal conditions, the blue dominates. \n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, during sunrise or sunset, the sky appears reddish because the sunlight has to pass through more atmosphere, scattering out the shorter wavelengths and leaving the longer ones. That's why the sun looks red or orange during those times.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but I should make sure I'm not confusing Rayleigh scattering with Mie scattering. Mie scattering is for larger particles, like water droplets or aerosols, which cause more uniform scattering and can lead to white or pale colors. That's why clouds appear white, as they scatter all wavelengths of light equally.\n",
       "\n",
       "So putting it all together, the primary reason the sky is blue is due to Rayleigh scattering of shorter wavelengths like blue and violet, combined with our eyes' sensitivity to blue light and the sun's emission spectrum. Also, the fact that violet is scattered even more but is less intense and our eyes are less sensitive to it explains why the sky isn't violet. \n",
       "\n",
       "I should also address possible misconceptions, like thinking the sky is blue because of reflection from the Earth's surface or something else. No, that's not the main reason. The main cause is indeed the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric molecules.\n",
       "</think>\n",
       "\n",
       "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**, which involves the interaction of sunlight with the molecules and small particles in Earth's atmosphere. Here's a concise explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Sunlight and Color**:\n",
       "   - Sunlight is composed of a spectrum of colors, each with different wavelengths (from violet/blue to red/orange).\n",
       "   - Shorter wavelengths (like **blue** and **violet**) are scattered more efficiently by the atmosphere than longer wavelengths (like red or yellow).\n",

      "Okay, the user is asking why the sky is blue. I remember from school that it has to do with light scattering, but I need to recall the exact details. Let me start by explaining that sunlight is white but consists of different colors. Each color has a different wavelength.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's Rayleigh scattering. I think that shorter wavelengths scatter more. Blue and violet have shorter wavelengths, so they scatter more. But why is the sky blue and not violet? Maybe because our eyes are more sensitive to blue, and the sun emits more blue light than violet. Also, some of the violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should mention that during sunrise or sunset, the sky turns red or orange because the light has to travel through more atmosphere, scattering the shorter wavelengths out of our line of sight. That's an important point to include for a complete answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure this step by step. Start with the composition of sunlight, then explain Rayleigh scattering, the role of blue and violet light, the sensitivity of human eyes, and the effect of atmospheric path length. Make sure to keep it simple and avoid jargon. Check if there's any confusion between Rayleigh and Mie scattering, but since the question is about the sky's color, Rayleigh is the main factor here. Also, maybe mention that the atmosphere's molecules (like nitrogen and oxygen) are the ones causing the scattering. Yeah, that's right. So putting it all together in a clear, concise way without getting too technical should work.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**, which involves how sunlight interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sunlight Composition**: Sunlight is a mix of all visible colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), each with different wavelengths. White light is a combination of these colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scattering of Light**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with gas molecules (like nitrogen and oxygen) and small particles. Shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more easily than longer wavelengths (red, orange, etc.). This is because the scattering intensity is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (Rayleigh scattering).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Why Blue, Not Violet?**:\n",
      "   - **Blue light** (around 450–495 nm) scatters more than violet (around 380–450 nm), but both are scattered.\n",
      "   - The **solar spectrum** emits more blue light than violet, and our eyes are more sensitive to blue.\n",
      "   - Some **violet light** is absorbed by the upper atmosphere, and our eyes perceive it less strongly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Result**: The scattered blue light fills the sky, making it appear blue to us. During sunrise or sunset, the sunlight travels through more atmosphere, scattering out the shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) and leaving the longer wavelengths (red/orange) to dominate, creating the reddish hues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the blue sky is a result of **shorter wavelengths (blue light) scattering more efficiently** in the atmosphere, combined with our eyes' sensitivity to blue and the sun's emission spectrum. 🌈\n"

The user is asking for the weather in SF, and every time I try to call the weather_agent function, I get the same error about needing user_msg or chat_history. But the tool's parameters were supposed to be run_args, not user_msg. Maybe there was a mistake in the tool's setup, and the correct parameter is something else. Let me try passing the location as a parameter in run_args, even though the parameters weren't defined. Alternatively, maybe the tool expects a different structure. I'll make a guess and include the location in the arguments.\\n</think>\\n\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3', 'created_at': '2025-07-16T14:54:47.264986Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 3523344417, 'load_duration': 45529958, 'prompt_eval_count': 1336, 'prompt_eval_duration': 126957583, 'eval_count': 152, 'eval_duration': 3318751250, 'model_name': 'qwen3'}, id='run--b5178b20-10fa-472a-9d8d-68f1433db0c2-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'weather_agent', 'args': {'run_args': {'location': 'San Francisco'}}, 'id': '2b4e66fc-d0ac-4193-985c-87c2065b3e35', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1336, 'output_tokens': 152, 'total_tokens': 1488})]}}\n",
